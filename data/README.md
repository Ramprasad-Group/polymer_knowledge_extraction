## Description of datasets

- `Mat-intelligence_data/apl.json` is a list of application tokens for the materials science space. More information on this can be found in Ref. [1](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00470)

- `analogies\_dataset/modified_analogies.txt` contains analogy pairs for general English language and inorganic materials science tasks.

- `analogies\_dataset/analogy\_plot_entries.csv` contains the analogies used to plot Fig. 5 in the paper [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220311196)

- `analogies/polymer_datasets` contains the analogy pairs for each task in Table 1 of the paper [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004220311196)
