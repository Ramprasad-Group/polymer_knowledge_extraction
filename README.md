## Requirements and Setup

- Python 3.6+
- Gensim (tested with version 3.8.0)
- Numpy (tested with version 1.17.4)
- Chemdataextractor (tested with version 1.3.0)

You can install all required Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running IPython Notebook Demo

The Word2Vec model described in the paper can be found at 10.6084/m9.figshare.13211015. The notebook contains starter code to access the word vector model and replicate some of the experiments from the paper such as computing nearest neighbors in word vector space and computing analogies.
